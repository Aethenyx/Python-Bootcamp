# In python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 34 # integer
name = "Aethenyx" # string
cgpa = 4.78 # float 

# Rules defining a cariable in python:
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z)(A-Z) or an underscore(_)
# They can contain letters, numbers and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names.
